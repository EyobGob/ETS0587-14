# STRING METHODS

# Day1
# str.lower() Method
The str.lower() method in Python is a built-in string method that converts all uppercase characters in a string to lowercase. It does not modify the original string but instead returns a new string with the modifications. This method is particularly useful for standardizing text (e.g., for case-insensitive comparisons or processing user input).

# str.upper() Method
The str.upper() method in Python is a built-in string method that converts all lowercase alphabetic characters in a string to uppercase. Like str.lower(), it creates a new string and leaves the original string unchanged. This method is handy for standardizing text to uppercase, especially for formatting or case-insensitive processing.

# str.capitalize() Method
The str.capitalize() method in Python is a built-in string method that capitalizes the first character of a string while converting all other characters to lowercase. This is especially useful for formatting strings into a sentence-like structure.

# Day2
# str.title() Method
In Python, the str.title() method is used to capitalize the first letter of each word in a string while converting all other letters in the word to lowercase. It's a handy method for formatting text into a title-like style.

# str.swapcase() Method
The str.swapcase() method in Python is used to reverse the case of each character in a string. It converts lowercase letters to uppercase and uppercase letters to lowercase. This can be useful when working with case conversions or for stylistic purposes.

# str.find() Method
The str.find() method in Python is used to locate the position of a specified substring within a string. It returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring if found, or -1 if the substring isn't found.
