# STRING METHODS

# Day1
# str.lower() Method
The str.lower() method in Python is a built-in string method that converts all uppercase characters in a string to lowercase. It does not modify the original string but instead returns a new string with the modifications. This method is particularly useful for standardizing text (e.g., for case-insensitive comparisons or processing user input).

# str.upper() Method
The str.upper() method in Python is a built-in string method that converts all lowercase alphabetic characters in a string to uppercase. Like str.lower(), it creates a new string and leaves the original string unchanged. This method is handy for standardizing text to uppercase, especially for formatting or case-insensitive processing.

# str.capitalize() Method
The str.capitalize() method in Python is a built-in string method that capitalizes the first character of a string while converting all other characters to lowercase. This is especially useful for formatting strings into a sentence-like structure.

# Day2
# str.title() Method
In Python, the str.title() method is used to capitalize the first letter of each word in a string while converting all other letters in the word to lowercase. It's a handy method for formatting text into a title-like style.

# str.swapcase() Method
The str.swapcase() method in Python is used to reverse the case of each character in a string. It converts lowercase letters to uppercase and uppercase letters to lowercase. This can be useful when working with case conversions or for stylistic purposes.

# str.find() Method
The str.find() method in Python is used to locate the position of a specified substring within a string. It returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring if found, or -1 if the substring isn't found.

# Day3
# str.index() Method
The str.index() method is used to find the index (position) of the first occurrence of a substring within a given string. It's a fundamental string manipulation tool in Python.

# str.startswith() Method
The str.startswith() method in Python is a powerful tool for checking if a string begins with a specific prefix. Here's a comprehensive overview:
The primary function of str.startswith() is to determine whether a given string begins with a specified substring (prefix).
It returns a Boolean value: True if the string starts with the prefix, and False otherwise.

# str.endswith() Method
The str.endswith() method in Python mirrors str.startswith() but checks the end of a string instead of the beginning. Here's a comprehensive look:
str.endswith() determines if a string ends with a specified suffix (substring).
It returns a Boolean value: True if the string ends with the suffix, and False otherwise.
