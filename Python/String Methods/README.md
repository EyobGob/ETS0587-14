# STRING METHODS
# str.lower() Mmethod
The str.lower() method in Python is a built-in string method that converts all uppercase characters in a string to lowercase. It does not modify the original string but instead returns a new string with the modifications. This method is particularly useful for standardizing text (e.g., for case-insensitive comparisons or processing user input).

# str.upper() Mmethod
The str.upper() method in Python is a built-in string method that converts all lowercase alphabetic characters in a string to uppercase. Like str.lower(), it creates a new string and leaves the original string unchanged. This method is handy for standardizing text to uppercase, especially for formatting or case-insensitive processing.

# str.capitalize() Mmethod
The str.capitalize() method in Python is a built-in string method that capitalizes the first character of a string while converting all other characters to lowercase. This is especially useful for formatting strings into a sentence-like structure.
