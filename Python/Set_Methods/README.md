# add() Method
The add() method in Python is used to add a specified element to a set. If the element is already present in the set, the set remains unchanged (as sets do not allow duplicate elements).

Adds a Single Element: You can only add one element at a time using add().
No Duplicates: If you try to add an element that already exists in the set, nothing happens. The set will not contain multiple instances of the same element.
Modifies the Set In-Place: The add() method directly alters the original set. It doesn't return a new set.
Immutable Elements: You can only add immutable elements (like numbers, strings, and tuples) to a set. Trying to add mutable elements (like lists or dictionaries) will result in a TypeError.

# update() Method
The update() method in Python is used to add multiple elements to a set from an iterable (such as another set, list, tuple, or string). For each element in the iterable, if it's not already present in the set, it will be added. Duplicate elements from the iterable are ignored, and the original set is modified in-place.

# remove() Method
The remove() method in Python attempts to remove a specified element from a set. If the element is found within the set, it is removed. However, if the element is not present in the set, the remove() method will raise a KeyError, halting the program if not handled with error handling mechanisms (like a try-except block).

# discard()
The discard() method takes one argument, which is the element you want to remove from the set. If the specified element exists within the set, discard() will remove it. Crucially, if the element is not found in the set, discard() does nothing and does not raise an error.

Takes one argument: The element to be removed.
Removes if present: If the element exists in the set, it is removed.
No error if absent: If the element does not exist in the set, the set remains unchanged, and no KeyError or any other exception is raised.
Modifies the set in-place: The discard() method directly alters the original set. It does not return a new set.

# pop()
The pop() method, when called on a set, removes and returns one element from the set. Because sets are inherently unordered collections, there's no specific "first" or "last" element. Therefore, the element that is popped is arbitrary; you cannot predict which element will be removed.

No arguments: The pop() method does not take any arguments.
Removes and returns: It modifies the set by removing an element and also returns the element that was removed.
Arbitrary element: Due to the unordered nature of sets, the element removed is not based on index or any specific order. It's effectively a random element from the set.
Raises KeyError if empty: If you call pop() on an empty set, it will raise a KeyError because there are no elements to remove and return.

# union()
The union() method takes one or more iterable objects as arguments. It returns a new set that contains all the unique elements present in the original set and in all the iterable objects passed as arguments. Duplicate elements are automatically eliminated in the resulting set.

Takes one or more arguments: These arguments must be iterable objects (e.g., sets, lists, tuples, strings).
Returns a new set: The union() method does not modify the original set. It creates and returns a brand new set containing the combined unique elements.
Combines elements: It includes all elements from the original set and all elements from the iterable(s) passed as arguments.
Ensures uniqueness: Duplicate elements, even if they appear multiple times across the original set and the iterables, will only appear once in the resulting set.

# intersection()
The intersection() method returns a new set containing only the elements that are present in all the sets you call it on. It doesn't modify the original sets.
You can call intersection() on one set and pass one or more other sets as arguments. Python will then compare all these sets and identify the elements that exist in every single one.


# difference()
The difference() method returns a new set containing all the elements from the set you call it on that are not present in the other set(s) you provide as arguments. Like intersection(), it doesn't alter the original sets.
You call difference() on one set, and you can pass one or more other sets as arguments. Python will then compare the first set with all the subsequent sets and identify the elements that are exclusive to the first set.

# symmetric_difference()
The symmetric_difference() method returns a new set containing all the elements that are in exactly one of the sets being compared. Elements that are present in both sets are excluded from the resulting set. The original sets remain unchanged.
You call symmetric_difference() on one set and pass another set as an argument. Python will then identify the elements that appear in the first set but not the second, and the elements that appear in the second set but not the first. These unique elements from both sets are combined into a new set.

# issubset() method
The issubset() method is a built-in function specifically designed for set objects. It provides a clean and readable way to perform the subset check without needing to iterate through the elements manually.

# issuperset() method
It is a method for set objects that efficiently determines if one set contains all the elements of another set, returning a boolean value. It's the logical counterpart to issubset() and is useful in scenarios where you need to verify the presence of all required elements.

# isdisjoint()
if you have two sets, let's call them set1 and set2, set1.isdisjoint(set2) will return True if there's absolutely no overlap between them â€“ meaning they share no common elements. If they do have one or more elements in common, it'll return False.
imagine you have two groups of friends. isdisjoint() tells you if there's anyone who is a friend in both groups. If the answer is no (they are disjoint), then isdisjoint() is True. If there's even one person in both groups, then they are not disjoint, and isdisjoint() is False.

# clear()
It's a very direct and simple operation: it removes all elements from a set, effectively making it an empty set.
Think of it like emptying a physical container. If your set is like a box filled with items, calling clear() is like reaching in and taking everything out, leaving you with an empty box.
