# append()
The append() method in Python is a fundamental list method used to add a single element to the end of a list. 
The primary purpose of append() is to modify a list in-place by adding a new element at the very end.
It increases the length of the list by one.

# extend()
In Python, the extend() method is a powerful and efficient way to add multiple elements to the end of a list. It modifies the original list in place, meaning it doesn't create a new list.
The primary purpose of extend() is to append all the items from an iterable (like another list, tuple, string, set, or dictionary's keys) to the end of an existing list.
The extend() method iterates through each item in the iterable and appends each individual item to the end of list1. This is different from the append() method, which adds the entire iterable as a single element to the end of the list.

# insert()
In Python, the insert() method is a built-in list method that allows you to add an element to a list at a specific index. Unlike append(), which always adds elements to the end of the list, insert() provides precise control over where the new element is placed.
The primary purpose of insert() is to insert a given element into a list at a specified index. All the elements originally at and after that index are shifted one position to the right to accommodate the new element.
