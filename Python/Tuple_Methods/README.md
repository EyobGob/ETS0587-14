# count() method 
The count() method for a tuple is like asking, "How many marbles in this bag are of a specific color?".
You give the method a value (which is like specifying the color you're interested in), and it goes through the entire tuple and tells you how many times that specific value appears.
For example, if you have the tuple ('red', 'blue', 'red', 'green', 'red') and you use count('red'), the result would be 3 because the color 'red' appears three times in the tuple.

# index() method
The index() method helps you find the first position number (index) of a specific item (value) in that line.
So, if you have a tuple like ('cat', 'dog', 'bird', 'dog') and you ask for the index('dog'), it will tell you 1 because the first 'dog' is at the second position, which has an index of 1 (since we start counting from 0).
If the item you're looking for isn't in the tuple, Python will let you know with an error.
